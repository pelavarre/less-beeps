## What Makes These Games Different

In place of rigid rules, our games adapt to you.
Each of our games includes Easter Eggs that let you modify gameplay.
You control the experience, not the other way around

**Available games**
- **TicTacTuh** (Tic-Tac-Toe, but fun)
- **Chuckers** (Checkers inspired)
- **Guh** (Go but inside a Terminal Window Pane)
- **Chuss** (Chess reimagined)
- **Pung** (PongÂ® homage)
- **Puckmuhn** (Pac-ManÂ® style)
- **Snuck** (SnakesÂ® variant)
- **DughDugh** (Dig-DugÂ® 1982 brought into this century)
- **Tetrus** (TetrisÂ® inspired)
- **Pentuminuh** (Pentominos in place of TetrisÂ® TetrominosÂ®)
- **Lugohs** (LEGOÂ®-style building)

**Presently available games**
- Zero games implemented, first game in development

We do have versions of
Tic-Tac-Tuh, Chuckers, Chuss, Pung, Snuck, and Puckmahn,
elsewhere in GitHub.
But presently we're starting over here
to make them all soon so much better


## The Visual Experience

Terminals from today
support colorful Unicode characters that make these games shine

> âšª âš« ðŸ”´ ðŸ”µ ðŸŸ  ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ£ ðŸŸ¤ <br>
> â¬› â¬œ ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ§ ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸ© ðŸŸª ðŸŸ« <br>

These wide characters (2 Terminal Columns each) come across as lots more circular and square.
They give these games a look that's much more the look of a real board game,
not so much the look of early computing
that you get by trying to draw with only thin characters


## Game Controls

- **âŒƒD** to quit
- **Fn F1** for help
- **âŒ¥-Click** away from the cursor for options
- Keyboard, mouse, and touch screen supported

Or run a specific game without waiting for help
> python3 bin/less-beeps.py Pung <br>


## Installation Options

### macOS
Find a macOS Terminal in **Finder â†’ Go â†’ Utilities** <br>

### iOS
Find a Linux Terminal in **Safari** (requires internet connection) (also works in macOS) <br>

### Windows
Run **Python** directly inside a Windows Command Prompt <br>
Or run Python inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <br>

### Don't got those? You can still try a Linux, up free online
Google offers a free Linux Online, inside your Google Email, at
https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=terminal

*Note:
You can always click "Reject" on the authorization prompts
sent to you from Google's free Linux Online.
The Google Cloud Shell works fine either way.
You can ignore its false warnings about unsaved changes when closing.
Your Git Clones and Saved Games do persist between sessions*


## Spirit

These games preserve the spirit of classic computing:
simple, hackable, and user-controlled.
While graphics have improved (thanks to Unicode!),
the core experience remains timeless:
games that respond to how you want to play them


## Why "Less-Beeps"?

The rudest move
that many classic Terminal Apps made against you
was their constant beeping:
every move, every error, every event
triggering that sharp, attention-grabbing sound

Our games take a gentler approach.
Much calmer than Emacs and Vim, in particular
We give you less feedback, less often and more thoughtfully.
We show we care how you feel.
We can afford to care.
4 KiB is no longer a lot of memory

Less Beeps is what you've got,
when you find the max fun with the least noise
